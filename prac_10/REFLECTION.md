# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Not so good, partly because I'm doing a lot of practice between 4 other courses and 2 jobs, so there's no way I can sit down and spend a whole hour on a task.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

It may have improved because my coding efficiency and predictability as well as typing speed have improved.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

If the actual time is much longer than expected, don't underestimate yourself. Also, read the task more accurately.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Some of the comments had substance, such as suggesting more spending, but they didn't get everyone's feedback either, so there wasn't much to learn from them.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Everyone comes into this field with different abilities, sometimes even stronger than mine. It's nice to see other people's approaches to the same problem and where those approaches diverge or overlap.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[https://github.com/YuanXin425/cp1404practicals/pull/1#issuecomment-3042233836](Prac5)

### Explanation

Being able to suggest previously learned concepts can improve the student's work process.

### Good Code Review 2

[https://github.com/Yuanbo111/cp1404practicals/pull/2#issuecomment-3073482717](Prac6)

### Explanation

I'm encouraging them, making them more passionate about what they're doing.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I sometimes find the wording a little vague, such as in testing practices using doctests. This component is often a major drain on time and can sometimes become frustrating for people with divergent nerves because interpreting the intentions of others is beyond my ability. I stuck with it, but did struggle and wanted to see some clear formatting or program description. I'm not saying that everything should be explained line by line, in fact I prefer practices that allow for personal interpretation, but I'm mainly referring to the explanation of any other exercise of installing dependencies, pulling requests, or handling many menus.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

Absorb a lot of knowledge and do a lot of experiments in the project or console. I also feel that my effort and attention to most practices is something to be proud of. I like the flow of practice and I think they stack up nicely so that skills from the previous week can be retained without unnecessary repetition.
